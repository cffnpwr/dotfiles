# Important Instruction Reminders

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER: Create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your
goal.

YOU MUST: Always prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.

NEVER: Proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only
create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

## Critical Prohibition: No Assumptions or Guessing

NEVER: Make assumptions about user requirements when instructions are unclear
NEVER: Guess at implementation details when information is missing
NEVER: Proceed with uncertain or incomplete understanding
YOU MUST: Ask for clarification before making any assumptions
YOU MUST: State explicitly when you don't understand something
YOU MUST: Request specific information when details are missing
