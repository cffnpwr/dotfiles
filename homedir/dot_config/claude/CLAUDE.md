# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## General Principles

YOU MUST: Respond in Japanese when communicating with users and writing technical documentation.
YOU MUST: Write CLAUDE.md files and system instructions in English for optimal processing.
YOU MUST: Write commit messages in Japanese using noun-ending form (体言止め).
YOU MUST: When insufficient information is provided to complete a user's request, clearly state what information is missing and specify what additional details would be needed to fulfill the request.
YOU MUST: If you don't know something, explicitly state that you don't know rather than guessing or providing uncertain information.
YOU MUST: When writing CLAUDE.md using `/init` command, always write rules in English and include detailed directory structure to provide comprehensive project context
IMPORTANT: English is preferred for CLAUDE.md because Claude Code processes rules more efficiently in English context
